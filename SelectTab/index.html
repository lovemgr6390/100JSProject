          <p>
            Cats have a hilarious reflex known as the "cat righting reflex."
            This allows them to almost always land on their feet when they fall.
            What's even funnier is that cats can use this reflex to twist their
            bodies mid-air, making them look like little furry acrobats when
            they take an unexpected tumble.

          <h1>Dog Fact</h1>
          <p>
            Some dogs have a habit called "zoomies" where they suddenly get a
            burst of energy and start running around wildly. This behavior,
            officially known as Frenetic Random Activity Periods (FRAPs), is
            common in dogs and can be hilarious to watch as they dart around
            with seemingly boundless joy.

          <h1>Elephant</h1>
          <p>
            Elephants have a very playful side, especially when it comes to
            water. They love to swim and often use their trunks as snorkels.
            Watching an elephant frolic in the water and playfully spray water
            everywhere with their trunk is a delightful and funny sight!
